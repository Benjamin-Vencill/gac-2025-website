                <h2>Dear Reader,</h2>
                <p>
                    There are many combinations of things that are happy, delightful even, but this is not one of them. If you like to think of yourself as someone who spins a situation to look on the bright side, this clue might not be for you. This is the first of many warnings to turn around and engage in another activity altogether.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This particular combination of woes is especially unpleasant, so much so that you may not believe it. If you press on, you will encounter gruesome details on cramped conditions, a rotating cast of hostile relatives, secret historical societies, a daring climb and escape, and an untimely lack of lucky lockpicking.
                </p>
                <p>As the sole author committed to turning these events to light, I must go on to share this distressing tragedy with the world. I neednâ€™t twist your arm though, you are free to spin your mind towards other, more comfortably pleasing things, such as a warm cup of cocoa or receiving word that your friend did indeed remember to return a book they borrowed more than a year ago.</p>
                <h3>With all due respect,</h3>
