            <p class="notebook-paper-body-text">
                It is a curious fact of human history that many ill-advised endeavors begin not with careful planning or noble purpose, but with a simple and dangerous thought: “Wouldn’t it be cool if…?” Such was the case with the regrettable creation of Get-A-Clue, which sprang to life in the unfortunate Spring of 1989. The mastermind behind this debacle was one Jim Tobin, a trombone player of dubious renown whose greatest contribution to society up to that point had been irritating a man named Bucky, who undoubtedly deserved better.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="notebook-paper notebook-paper-b">
            <p class="notebook-paper-body-text">
                Jim, after watching the cinematic oddity known as Midnight Madness—a film that inexplicably inspired not caution but enthusiasm—approached Brian Hollahan, a Pledge Trainer for Kappa Kappa Psi. “Wouldn’t it be cool,” Jim suggested, “if we orchestrated a game like that for the band?” While any sensible person would have politely declined and perhaps confiscated Jim’s access to both trombones and movies, Brian agreed. Thus, the Clueless Officer's Club was formed—a group whose name was, I assure you, entirely appropriate.</p>
        <div class="notebook-paper notebook-paper-a">
            <p class="notebook-paper-body-text">
                Despite later de-pledging (a term which here means “wisely abandoning a doomed association”), Jim remained at the helm of this operation, directing the inaugural Get-A-Clue Road Adventure. This so-called “game” was enthusiastically received by participants, many of whom were unaware that they had also signed up for trespassing, encounters with disgruntled security guards, and the dubious honor of meeting Atlanta’s least charming law enforcement officers.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="notebook-paper notebook-paper-b">
            <p class="notebook-paper-body-text">
                The early iterations of Get-A-Clue were plagued with flaws, which is a polite way of saying that they were riddled with catastrophes. Teams were assigned predetermined routes, ensuring that everyone had an equal chance of getting hopelessly lost. The game began at dusk on Saturday, a time carefully chosen to maximize both confusion and exhaustion. And yet, amidst the chaos, some participants inexplicably enjoyed themselves. One bewildered player, reflecting on the absurdity of it all, remarked, “We just spent 10 hours in a car, driving aimlessly and subsisting on donuts. Imagine what we could accomplish if we applied this level of effort to something meaningful.”

        </div>
        <div class="notebook-paper notebook-paper-a">
            <p class="notebook-paper-body-text">
                Though few teams completed all the clues or reached the final party—a phrase which here means “a gathering where the survivors commiserated over their poor choices”—Get-A-Clue had begun, setting a precedent for a tradition that no one, save for Jim Tobin, had asked for.</p>
        </div>

    <div class="note-container note-container-top-pad">
        <div class="notebook-paper">
            <h2 class="notebook-paper-title-text">1991</h2>
            <p class="notebook-paper-body-text">
                By 1990, it seemed Get-A-Clue had met the same fate as countless other ill-conceived endeavors: it had quietly vanished, leaving behind only memories, vague injuries, and perhaps a warrant or two. Yet, just as hope was all but extinguished, a man named Ben Cowan took it upon himself to resurrect the game. Whether this was an act of bravery, folly, or both remains a matter of historical debate.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="notebook-paper notebook-paper-b">
            <p class="notebook-paper-body-text">
                To rekindle enthusiasm, Ben devised a miniature version of the chaos: <em>Get-A-Clue Lite</em>. This smaller-scale calamity took place during Band Camp in the fall of 1990, confining participants to the relative safety of campus and providing easier clues to help RATs (a term here referring to band newcomers, rather than literal vermin) acclimate to the game. It was a modest success—or at least, no major injuries were reported—and paved the way for <em>Get Another Clue</em> in the spring of 1991.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="notebook-paper notebook-paper-b">
            <p class="notebook-paper-body-text">
                This revamped version of the game introduced a host of innovations, some of which were improvements and some of which were simply... additions. Clue sites were labeled with Greek letters, lending the game an air of academic legitimacy it absolutely did not deserve. Permissions were sought from shopkeepers, sparing players from the dubious thrill of trespassing. For the first time, Help Clues were offered—tiny crumbs of guidance designed to assist lost or despairing teams. These help clues were assigned time penalties, though the exact penalties were decided <em>after</em> the game, due to Game Control’s uncertainty about how many teams would inevitably flounder.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="notebook-paper notebook-paper-a">
            <p class="notebook-paper-body-text">
                The mechanics remained delightfully impractical: teams were pre-assigned routes and required to locate functional payphones at each clue site to report their progress. This, of course, added an extra layer of difficulty, as payphones were about as reliable as the clues themselves. The game’s conclusion was suitably dramatic, with two teams finishing mere minutes apart. A dispute arose regarding the impact of Help Clues on the final standings, but in a rare moment of band spirit—or perhaps shared exhaustion—the teams agreed to declare a tie.
            </p>

        <div class="notebook-paper  notebook-paper-b">
            <p class="notebook-paper-body-text">
                More importantly, they established a new and dubious tradition: the winners would be saddled with the burden of organizing the following year’s game. This rule, while ensuring the game’s survival, can only be described as punishment masquerading as legacy.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="notebook-paper notebook-paper-a">
            <p class="notebook-paper-body-text">
                As for how the game began that year, it seems teams were sent out at staggered intervals based on some inscrutable system, likely registration order. Or perhaps it was random. Or perhaps no one really knew. Such is the way of Get-A-Clue: part tradition, part confusion, and entirely inexplicable.

            <h2 class="notebook-paper-title-text">1992</h2>
            <p class="notebook-paper-body-text">
                And so, we move on to Spring 1992. This game, <em>Get Yet Another Clue</em>, was run by Fireball and contained several of the concepts started with the first two GACs, including color-coded envelopes for each of the teams, Greek letters to represent the clue sites, and a bag of quarters given to each of the teams to use in the pay phones. The game ran well except for one slight flaw—routes were unequal for each of the teams. Again, as was the custom, routes were predetermined by Game Control for each of the teams—at each cluesite, you looked for your team's colored envelopes.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="notebook-paper notebook-paper-b">
            <p class="notebook-paper-body-text">
                Although there was a greater than 100-mile difference between the 1st and 2nd place teams, the first team was declared the winner, and was sentenced to put on the game the next year.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="notebook-paper notebook-paper-a">
            <p class="notebook-paper-body-text">
                The last team to finish called in its last clue at 7:32 in the morning, more than 15 hours after the game started... and later that afternoon, the band had a Masterworks Concert at the brand-new Ferst Center. Needless to say, some people were woken up jussssst in time for the performance. Memorable clues included a periodic table code that led to Fernbank Science Center, following the leader at Georgia State North Metro Campus, the three billy goats gruff on Azalea Drive in Roswell, and of course, Charon, a rowboat, and Lake Allatoona.

                <strong>Opening Clue:</strong> Each team was given 20 pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, with "Fireball, Go To Class" written on the back. In the team packets was Fireball's class schedule, with only one location stated, at the Mason Civil Engineering building.
