                    <h2>What Is Get A Clue?</h2>
                    <p>Get A Clue (GAC) is an annual puzzle hunt hosted every spring in Atlanta. It is a city-wide, full-day hunt where teams will travel to various locations in the metropolitan Atlanta area, solving clues and completing challenges along the way. If you're completely new to the game, we highly recommend viewing the series of videos produced by the 2011 Game Control team to get a better idea of what's going on.</p>

                    <h2>When is GAC?</h2>
                    <p>Get a Clue 2025 will take place on April 4th. Registration will open at 7:30am, and the game will start promptly at 8:30am. There is no hard end time, but we expect most teams will finish by 7:00pm.</p>

                <div class="intro intro-lean-left burned">
                    <h2>How much does it cost to play?</h2>
                    <p>Registration is a flat $50 for as many people as can wear seatbelts in the team's means of transportation. If you have an active Tech band person on your team, we'll give you a $10 discount bringing your registration cost to $40.</p>

                <div class="intro intro-lean-right">
                    <h2>What if I'm lonely and don't have friends to play with me?</h2>
                    <p>Ask around! Ask your RAT parents! Ask your co-workers! If you really want to do GAC but have literally nobody to do it with, email us! We'll get you in contact with other clue-solving vagrants so you can form a team and compete. Coincidentally, if you already have a team but wouldn't mind adding a new member or two, let us know in the registration form.</p>

                    <h2>What if I rent an RV?</h2>
                    <p>As long as there are enough seatbelts for the entire team, then you are good to go!</p>

                    <h2>What kind of clues should we expect?</h2>
                    <p>Clues are traditionally puzzles of all sorts, requiring a cross-section of trivia, logic, spatial reasoning, recognition, engineering, and music skills, and perhaps even more. For examples of past clues, the Get A Clue Archives have clues and solutions from a number of past games.</p>

                <div class="intro intro-lean-left notebook">
                    <h2>That sounds hard! What if weâ€™re not so great at puzzles?</h2>
                    <p>That's okay! Hints will be available for every clue, and you always have the option to skip a clue if you're totally stuck or just not enjoying it.</p>

                <div class="intro intro-lean-right ">
                    <h2>How do you win? What's the prize?</h2>
                    <p>The first team to complete all the clues, plus any additional penalties, minus bonuses, wins! The winning team is charged with the honor/responsibility of hosting the subsequent year's Get A Clue (thus making the 2nd place team "The Real Winners").</p>

                    <p>We are Game Control! We run the game for the year and create all the clues. We also have done this a few times before.</p>
