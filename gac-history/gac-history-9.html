        <p class="notebook-paper-body-text"> 2017: Dungeons and GACons  The 2016 game was won by outsider team Teensy But Vicious, who promptly disappeared from the face of the earth. Despite a few false flags from a Band Header spammer, nobody had seen or heard anything about a 2017 game well into the new year. As March approached, puzzle lovers began to resign themselves to the idea that there might not be a game that year. At the last minute (literally, a month before game time) a group of masochists/GAC veterans decided to throw sanity to the wind and take on the mantle of Game Control. Planned in under a month, the 2017 featured a Dungeons and Dragons theme and literal minutes of clue testing, followed by a premature end</p>

        <p class="notebook-paper-body-text"> 2018: Clue  A classic game of Clue left each team with a different answer of who did it, where, and with what weapon. Allusions to Communism served as red herrings to throw teams off the scent. The same masochists that put together the last-minute game in 2017 took it upon themselves to host again, this time with more time to plan and execute. </p>

Jk, not really, Voldemort was summering in the Hamptons. While on their hunt, teams took a break to enjoy Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans, to exchange bronze keys, and to spend quality time with their pet frog, cat, or owl. Teams also learned plenty of Fun Facts! Fun fact! J.K. Rowling has confirmed that Dobby assassinated Princess Diana. </p>
