        <p class="notebook-paper-body-text"> 2011: CSI: Atlanta  After rigorous (three or four whole minutes) research, it appears that we're the first team to host GAC a second time. A whopping three years after we did it last time. Oops. Oh well, at least we've had practice. Have fun, suckers.  </p>

        <p class="notebook-paper-body-text"> 2012: THE END IS NIGH!  Heaven's GAC or the Greater Atlanta Cult had found that the world was going to end not on 12/21/12 but much earlier. Good news is that they had found a path to salvation and handed the teams a minimalist survival guide (l3 pages) and a box of twinkles. This was the first year game control introduced QR codes that acted as check-in, links for help clues, and checking clue solutions. The game ran so smoothly that game control was actually calling teams seconds after they noticed teams were having troubles figuring clues out (we literally only had 10 actually phone calls from people calling us). Another thing that Game Control pioneered was a hard stop timeâ€¦ the end</p>

        <p class="notebook-paper-body-text"> 2013: GAC goes to Vegas  What happens in Vegas.... ends up in Get A Clue! Teams slowly worked through puzzles to reassemble fragments of a hellacious night out on the town as found in the movie "The Hangover." This game theme also included many references to Game Control's pet dogs. Memorable clues include running around Atlantic Station, IKEA furniture shopping, finding the teams' faces photoshopped in the Little Chapel of Vegas, and playing Duck Tales. This year continued the use of QR codes for checking in at the clue location and received their next clue through email. </p>

A few (ahem, the future Game Control included) went anyway. Instead, teams were sent to one of three start locations: the Silver Skillet Diner, the Krispy Kreme on Ponce, or Starbucks.  </p>
